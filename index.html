                Electricians are people who have been trained in the trade of electrical wiring. They can install and maintain electrical systems in both residential and commercial buildings. Most electricians start their careers as apprentices, working under the supervision of a licensed electrician. After several years of training and experience, they may become licensed themselves.

Electricians typically work indoors and outdoors, in all types of weather. They may be required to travel to different job sites, so a valid driver’s license is often necessary.
